# Citi Bike Program - NYC

For this Tableau challenge, I used June 2013 data, the first month of the program

## Observations

One of the first things I noticed that changed how I approached this data was that gender and birth year was only recorded for subscribers, not regular customers. 

The peak age for subscribers is 30, with a sharp drop off for anyone under the age of 28 and a very gradual decline for anyone older than 30. The majority of subscribers seems to be between 28-50. The average trip duration is highest among the youngest (18) and oldest (50-80) however. This is likely because the smaller count in each group, while the largest age ranges have more people that weigh down the group average.

Three bikes in particular have far more trip time on them than the average: #15259, #17918, #19866. All 3 have over 1.8m seconds during the month of June. 

The map portion of the project showed that the most common Starting Stations were on the center to west half of Manhattan, notably near Central Park, Time Square, and along the coast by the Statue of Liberty. The further southeast on the map, the less popular the station. This trend also seemed to continue for Ending Stations. There were trips that did not contain Ending Stations, but this made up a small portion of the data (<4%).
