# Citi Bike Program - NYC

For this Tableau challenge, I used June 2013 data, the first month of the program

## Observations

The map portion of the project showed that the most common Starting Stations were on the center to west half of Manhattan, notably near Central Park, Time Square, and along the coast by the Statue of Liberty. The further southeast on the map, the less popular the station. This trend also seemed to continue for Ending Stations. There were trips that did not contain Ending Stations, but this made up a small portion of the data (<4%).
